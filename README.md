# Cross-site Scripting
## Before...
-> Before we start talking about Cross-site-scripting (XSS), it's important to talk about what a web applications and vulnerability.
### Web application
-> Basically, a web application is a piece of software that runs in a web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox etc. Why understand what a web application is? precisely because Cross-site-scripting (XSS) is caused by flaws in web applications themselves. Like Facebook, Olx etc.
### Vulnerability
-> Vulnerability is precisely a weakness in a web application that is exploited through bugs or the structure of the web application itself, if it has flaws, and it is in these flaws that people with malicious intentions can gain access to sensitive and important data.
#### XSS
<p>-> XSS is an injection attack based on JavaScript. They inject into a web application with the focus of being executed by other users. In this way, it can send malicious code to other people who may mistakenly click on a script that captures sensitive or important information. </p>
